Query data to see which country has the most volcanoes and then you find the shortest path back to Wichita Falls highlighting any cities and airports you travel through
Query data clustering earthquakes around a specific valcanoe then using it to find the closest cluster of cites then usinging the city clusters finding the close international airport and finding our way back to wichita falls lighting up the countries and then the states we hit along the way
query data by selecting a valcanoe on a map then we figure out what states and countries we go to see it, the catch is however if it is by a earthquake spot we have a chance that we need to be rereouted to a safe city where no earthquakes are happening
